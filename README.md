HerpLog
----------
***HerpLog*** is a fast, secure and advanced notetaker, logger/statistics, and needs-manager for all your herpetology requirements. It is built upon the [Qt5](https://www.qt.io/) GUI library framework and written in the highly efficient C++ language, only using the most modern and well written in external libraries. In the near future, it will be capable of satisfying all of your herpetology logging needs. It is aimed at the Linux and [Microsoft Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/) operating systems, with both the x86_64 and x86 architectures included under this umbrella. This program is also provided for free as-is under the ***GNU General Public License v3.0*** along with the source code, which you may peruse at your leisure and feel completely free to modify. Please do note that we are in heavy development at the moment and not ready for a stable release just yet.

If you wish to contribute your own code to this project then [GekkoFyre](https://github.com/gekkofyre) is more than happy to accept your submission! You may either pull to the project directly or otherwise contact [phobos-dthorga](https://github.com/phobos-dthorga), the lead author, at *phobos[dot]gekko[at]gmail[dot]com* with your needs. Any and all contributions are welcomed and you will be added to the `AUTHORS` file accordingly!

Binaries
----------
There are no binaries and/or install-wizards available at this time, due to the fact that this software project is in a stage of intense development right now. Once a state of stability is reached that will allow for an alpha release, binaries will then be uploaded to [Vitticeps](https://www.vitticeps.org/) for both Microsoft Windows and Linux operating systems. If you wish to be notified of major developments like this, then feel free to subscribe to the newsletter on the right-hand side of this page. Emails will only be sent intermittently at most so as not to create any spam, since I hate spam as much as anyone else does :)
